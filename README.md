# CRUD-Project
A React.js application implementing full CRUD operations with JSONPlaceholder API. It leverages React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for state and lifecycle management, BlueprintJS for UI components, and Toaster for notifications. Users can be created, retrieved, updated (inline editing), and deleted, with changes reflected dynamically in the UI.
